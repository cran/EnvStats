\details{
  Let \eqn{\underline{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N)} denote a vector of \eqn{N}
  observations from some positive-valued distribution with mean
  \eqn{\mu} and standard deviation \eqn{\sigma}.
  Assume \eqn{n} (\eqn{0 < n < N}) of these
  observations are known and \eqn{c} (\eqn{c=N-n}) of these observations are
  all censored below (left-censored) or all censored above (right-censored) at
  \eqn{k} censoring levels
  \deqn{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_k; \; k \ge 1 \;\;\;\;\;\; (1)}
  Finally, let \eqn{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n} denote the \eqn{n} ordered uncensored
  observations.
  \cr

  \bold{Estimation} \cr
  It can be shown that the mean of a positive-valued distribution is equal to the
  area under the survival curve (Klein and Moeschberger, 2003, p.33):
  \deqn{\mu = \int_0^\infty [1 - F(t)] dt = \int_0^\infty S(t) dt \;\;\;\;\;\; (2)}
  where \eqn{F(t)} denotes the cumulative distribution function evaluated at \eqn{t}
  and \eqn{S(t) = 1 - F(t)} denotes the survival function evaluated at \eqn{t}.
  When the Kaplan-Meier estimator is used to construct the survival function,
  you can use the area under this curve to estimate the mean of the distribution,
  and the estimator can be as efficient or more efficient than
  parametric estimators of the mean (Meier, 2004; Helsel, 2012; Lee and Wang, 2003).
  Let \eqn{\hat{F}(t)} denote the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the empirical
  cumulative distribution function (ecdf) evaluated at \eqn{t}, and let
  \eqn{\hat{S}(t) = 1 - \hat{F}(t)} denote the estimated survival function evaluated
  at \eqn{t}.  (See the help files for \code{\link{ecdfPlotCensored}} and
  \code{\link{qqPlotCensored}} for an explanation of how the Kaplan-Meier
  estimator of the ecdf is computed.)

  The formula for the estimated mean is given by (Lee and Wang, 2003, p. 74):
  \deqn{\hat{\mu} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{S}(y_{i-1}) (y_{i} - y_{i-1}) \;\;\;\;\;\; (3)}
  where \eqn{y_{0} = 0} and \eqn{\hat{S}(y_{0}) = 1} by definition.  It can be
  shown that this formula is eqivalent to:
  \deqn{\hat{\mu} = \sum_{i=1}^n y_{i} [\hat{F}(y_{i}) - \hat{F}(y_{i-1})] \;\;\;\;\;\; (4)}
  where \eqn{\hat{F}(y_{0}) = \hat{F}(0) = 0} by definition
  (USEPA, 2009, p. 15-10; Singh et al., 2010, pp. 109--111; Beal, 2010).

  The formula for the estimated standard deviation is:
  \deqn{\hat{\sigma} = \{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_{i} - \hat{\mu})^2 [\hat{F}(y_{i}) - \hat{F}(y_{i-1})]\}^{1/2} \;\;\;\;\; (5)}
  (USEPA, 2009, p. 15-10), and the formula for the estimated standard error of the
  mean is:
  \deqn{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}} = [\sum_{r=1}^{n-1} \frac{A_r^2}{(N-r)(N-r+1)}]^{1/2} \;\;\;\;\;\; (6)}
  where
  \deqn{A_r = \sum_{i=r}^{n-1} \hat{S}(y_{i}) (y_{i+1} - y_{i}) \;\;\;\;\;\; (7)}
  (Lee and Wang, 2003, p. 74).  Kaplan and Meier suggest using a bias correction of
  \eqn{n/(n-1)} (Lee and Wang, 2003, p.75):
  \deqn{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}, BC} = \frac{n}{n-1} \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}} \;\;\;\;\;\; (8)}
  When \code{correct.se=TRUE}, Equation (8) is used instead of Equation (6).

  If the smallest value for left-censored data is censored and less than or equal to
  the smallest uncensored value then the estimated mean will be biased high, and
  if the largest value for right-censored data is censored and greater than or equal to
  the largest uncensored value, the the estimated mean will be biased low.  In these
  cases, the above formulas can and should be modified
  (Barker, 2009; Lee and Wang, 2003, p. 74).
  For left-censored data, the smallest censored observation can be treated as
  observed and set to the smallest censoring level (\code{left.censored.min="DL"}),
  half of the smallest censoring level (\code{left.censored.min="DL/2"}), or some other
  value greater than 0 and the smallest censoring level.  Setting
  \code{left.censored.min="Ignore"} uses the formulas given above (biased in this case)
  and is what is presented in Singh et al. (2010, pp. 109--111) and Beal (2010).
  USEPA (2009, pp. 15--7 to 15-10) on the other hand uses the method associated with
  \code{left.censored.min="DL"}.  For right-censored data, the largest censored
  observation can be treated as observed and set to the censoring level
  (\code{right.censored.max="DL"}) or some value greater than the largest censoring
  level.  In the survival analysis literature, this method of dealing with this
  situation is called estimating the \bold{\emph{restricted mean}}
  (Miller, 1981; Meier, 2004; Barker, 2009).
  \cr

  \bold{Confidence Intervals} \cr
  This section explains how confidence intervals for the mean \eqn{\mu} are
  computed.
  \cr

  \emph{Normal Approximation} (\code{ci.method="normal.approx"}) \cr
  This method constructs approximate \eqn{(1-\alpha)100\%} confidence intervals for
  \eqn{\mu} based on the assumption that the estimator of \eqn{\mu} is
  approximately normally distributed.  That is, a two-sided \eqn{(1-\alpha)100\%}
  confidence interval for \eqn{\mu} is constructed as:
  \deqn{[\hat{\mu} - t_{1-\alpha/2, m-1}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}}, \; \hat{\mu} + t_{1-\alpha/2, m-1}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}}] \;\;\;\; (9)}
  where \eqn{\hat{\mu}} denotes the estimate of \eqn{\mu},
  \eqn{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}}} denotes the estimated asymptotic standard
  deviation of the estimator of \eqn{\mu}, \eqn{m} denotes the assumed sample
  size for the confidence interval, and \eqn{t_{p,\nu}} denotes the \eqn{p}'th
  quantile of \link[stats:TDist]{Student's t-distribuiton} with \eqn{\nu}
  degrees of freedom.  One-sided confidence intervals are computed in a
  similar fashion.

  The argument \code{ci.sample.size} determines the value of \eqn{m}.
  By default, it is the observed number of uncensored observations.
  This is simply an ad-hoc method of constructing
  confidence intervals and is not based on any published theoretical results.

  When \code{pivot.statistic="z"}, the \eqn{p}'th quantile from the
  \link[stats:Normal]{standard normal distribution} is used in place of the
  \eqn{p}'th quantile from Student's t-distribution.
  \cr

  \emph{Bootstrap and Bias-Corrected Bootstrap Approximation} (\code{ci.method="bootstrap"}) \cr
  The bootstrap is a nonparametric method of estimating the distribution
  (and associated distribution parameters and quantiles) of a sample statistic,
  regardless of the distribution of the population from which the sample was drawn.
  The bootstrap was introduced by Efron (1979) and a general reference is
  Efron and Tibshirani (1993).

  In the context of deriving an approximate \eqn{(1-\alpha)100\%} confidence interval
  for the population mean \eqn{\mu}, the bootstrap can be broken down into the
  following steps:
  \enumerate{
    \item Create a bootstrap sample by taking a random sample of size \eqn{N} from
      the observations in \eqn{\underline{x}}, where sampling is done with
      replacement.  Note that because sampling is done with replacement, the same
      element of \eqn{\underline{x}} can appear more than once in the bootstrap
      sample.  Thus, the bootstrap sample will usually not look exactly like the
      original sample (e.g., the number of censored observations in the bootstrap
      sample will often differ from the number of censored observations in the
      original sample).

    \item Estimate \eqn{\mu} based on the bootstrap sample created in Step 1, using
      the same method that was used to estimate \eqn{\mu} using the original
      observations in \eqn{\underline{x}}. Because the bootstrap sample usually
      does not match the original sample, the estimate of \eqn{\mu} based on the
      bootstrap sample will usually differ from the original estimate based on
      \eqn{\underline{x}}.  For the bootstrap-t method (see below), this step also
      involves estimating the standard error of the estimate of the mean and
      computing the statistic \eqn{T = (\hat{\mu}_B - \hat{mu}) / \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}_B}}
      where \eqn{\hat{\mu}} denotes the estimate of the mean based on the original sample,
      and \eqn{\hat{\mu}_B} and \eqn{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}_B}} denote the estimate of
      the mean and estimate of the standard error of the estimate of the mean based on
      the bootstrap sample.

    \item Repeat Steps 1 and 2 \eqn{B} times, where \eqn{B} is some large number.
      For the function \code{enparCensored}, the number of bootstraps \eqn{B} is
      determined by the argument \code{n.bootstraps} (see the section ARGUMENTS above).
      The default value of \code{n.bootstraps} is \code{1000}.

    \item Use the \eqn{B} estimated values of \eqn{\mu} to compute the empirical
      cumulative distribution function of the estimator of \eqn{\mu} or to compute
      the empirical cumulative distribution function of the statistic \eqn{T}
      (see \code{\link{ecdfPlot}}), and then create a confidence interval for \eqn{\mu}
      based on this estimated cdf.
  }

  The two-sided percentile interval (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993, p.170) is computed as:
  \deqn{[\hat{G}^{-1}(\frac{\alpha}{2}), \; \hat{G}^{-1}(1-\frac{\alpha}{2})] \;\;\;\;\;\; (10)}
  where \eqn{\hat{G}(t)} denotes the empirical cdf of \eqn{\hat{\mu}_B} evaluated at \eqn{t}
  and thus \eqn{\hat{G}^{-1}(p)} denotes the \eqn{p}'th empirical quantile of the
  distribution of \eqn{\hat{\mu}_B}, that is, the \eqn{p}'th quantile associated with the
  empirical cdf.  Similarly, a one-sided lower
  confidence interval is computed as:
  \deqn{[\hat{G}^{-1}(\alpha), \; \infty] \;\;\;\;\;\; (11)}
  and a one-sided upper confidence interval is computed as:
  \deqn{[-\infty, \; \hat{G}^{-1}(1-\alpha)] \;\;\;\;\;\; (12)}
  The function \code{enparCensored} calls the \R function \code{\link[stats]{quantile}}
  to compute the empirical quantiles used in Equations (10)-(12).

  The percentile method bootstrap confidence interval is only first-order
  accurate (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993, pp.187-188), meaning that the probability
  that the confidence interval will contain the true value of \eqn{\mu} can be
  off by \eqn{k/\sqrt{N}}, where \eqn{k} is some constant.  Efron and Tibshirani
  (1993, pp.184--188) proposed a bias-corrected and accelerated interval that is
  second-order accurate, meaning that the probability that the confidence interval
  will contain the true value of \eqn{\mu} may be off by \eqn{k/N} instead of
  \eqn{k/\sqrt{N}}.  The two-sided bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval is
  computed as:
  \deqn{[\hat{G}^{-1}(\alpha_1), \; \hat{G}^{-1}(\alpha_2)] \;\;\;\;\;\; (13)}
  where
  \deqn{\alpha_1 = \Phi[\hat{z}_0 + \frac{\hat{z}_0 + z_{\alpha/2}}{1 - \hat{a}(z_0 + z_{\alpha/2})}] \;\;\;\;\;\; (14)}
  \deqn{\alpha_2 = \Phi[\hat{z}_0 + \frac{\hat{z}_0 + z_{1-\alpha/2}}{1 - \hat{a}(z_0 + z_{1-\alpha/2})}] \;\;\;\;\;\; (15)}
  \deqn{\hat{z}_0 = \Phi^{-1}[\hat{G}(\hat{\mu})] \;\;\;\;\;\; (16)}
  \deqn{\hat{a} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{\mu}_{(\cdot)} - \hat{\mu}_{(i)})^3}{6[\sum_{i=1}^N (\hat{\mu}_{(\cdot)} - \hat{\mu}_{(i)})^2]^{3/2}} \;\;\;\;\;\; (17)}
  where the quantity \eqn{\hat{\mu}_{(i)}} denotes the estimate of \eqn{\mu} using
  all the values in \eqn{\underline{x}} except the \eqn{i}'th one, and
  \deqn{\hat{\mu}{(\cdot)} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{\mu_{(i)}} \;\;\;\;\;\; (18)}
  A one-sided lower confidence interval is given by:
  \deqn{[\hat{G}^{-1}(\alpha_1), \; \infty] \;\;\;\;\;\; (19)}
  and a one-sided upper confidence interval is given by:
  \deqn{[-\infty, \; \hat{G}^{-1}(\alpha_2)] \;\;\;\;\;\; (20)}
  where \eqn{\alpha_1} and \eqn{\alpha_2} are computed as for a two-sided confidence
  interval, except \eqn{\alpha/2} is replaced with \eqn{\alpha} in Equations (14) and (15).

  The constant \eqn{\hat{z}_0} incorporates the bias correction, and the constant
  \eqn{\hat{a}} is the acceleration constant.  The term \dQuote{acceleration} refers
  to the rate of change of the standard error of the estimate of \eqn{\mu} with
  respect to the true value of \eqn{\mu} (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993, p.186).  For a
  normal (Gaussian) distribution, the standard error of the estimate of \eqn{\mu}
  does not depend on the value of \eqn{\mu}, hence the acceleration constant is not
  really necessary.

  For the bootstrap-t method, the two-sided confidence interval
  (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993, p.160) is computed as:
  \deqn{[\hat{\mu} - t_{1-\alpha/2}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}}, \; \hat{\mu} - t_{\alpha/2}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}}] \;\;\;\;\;\; (21)}
  where \eqn{\hat{\mu}} and \eqn{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}}} denote the estimate of the mean
  and standard error of the estimate of the mean based on the original sample, and
  \eqn{t_p} denotes the \eqn{p}'th empirical quantile of the bootstrap distribution of
  the statistic \eqn{T}.  Similarly, a one-sided lower confidence interval is computed as:
  \deqn{[\hat{\mu} - t_{1-\alpha}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}}, \; \infty] \;\;\;\;\;\; (22)}
  and a one-sided upper confidence interval is computed as:
  \deqn{[-\infty, \; \hat{\mu} - t_{\alpha}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\mu}}] \;\;\;\;\;\; (23)}

  When \code{ci.method="bootstrap"}, the function \code{enparCensored} computes
  the percentile method, bias-corrected and accelerated method, and bootstrap-t
  bootstrap confidence intervals.  The percentile method is transformation respecting,
  but not second-order accurate.  The bootstrap-t method is second-order accurate, but not
  transformation respecting.  The bias-corrected and accelerated method is both
  transformation respecting and second-order accurate (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993, p.188).

\note{
  A sample of data contains censored observations if some of the observations are
  reported only as being below or above some censoring level.  In environmental
  data analysis, Type I left-censored data sets are common, with values being
  reported as \dQuote{less than the detection limit} (e.g., Helsel, 2012).  Data
  sets with only one censoring level are called \emph{singly censored}; data sets with
  multiple censoring levels are called \emph{multiply} or \emph{progressively censored}.

  Statistical methods for dealing with censored data sets have a long history in the
  field of survival analysis and life testing.  More recently, researchers in the
  environmental field have proposed alternative methods of computing estimates and
  confidence intervals in addition to the classical ones such as maximum likelihood
  estimation.

  Helsel (2012, Chapter 6) gives an excellent review of past studies of the
  properties of various estimators based on censored environmental data.

  In practice, it is better to use a confidence interval for the mean or a
  joint confidence region for the mean and standard deviation, rather than rely on a
  single point-estimate of the mean.  Since confidence intervals and regions depend
  on the properties of the estimators for both the mean and standard deviation, the
  results of studies that simply evaluated the performance of the mean and standard
  deviation separately cannot be readily extrapolated to predict the performance of
  various methods of constructing confidence intervals and regions.  Furthermore,
  for several of the methods that have been proposed to estimate the mean based on
  type I left-censored data, standard errors of the estimates are not available,
  hence it is not possible to construct confidence intervals
  (El-Shaarawi and Dolan, 1989).

  Few studies have been done to evaluate the performance of methods for constructing
  confidence intervals for the mean or joint confidence regions for the mean and
  standard deviation when data are subjected to single or multiple censoring.
  See, for example, Singh et al. (2006).
