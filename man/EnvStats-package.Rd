  Package for Environmental Statistics, Including US EPA Guidance
}
\description{
  A comprehensive R package for environmental statistics and
  the successor to the S-PLUS module \emph{EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS}
  (first released in April, 1997).  \pkg{EnvStats} provides a set of powerful
  functions for graphical and statistical analyses of environmental data, with
  a focus on analyzing chemical concentrations and physical parameters, usually in
  the context of mandated environmental monitoring.  It includes major environmental
  statistical methods found in the literature and regulatory guidance documents,
  and extensive help that explains what these methods do, how to use them,
  and where to find them in the literature.  It also includes numerous built-in data
  sets from regulatory guidance documents and environmental statistics literature, and
  scripts reproducing analyses presented in the User's manual:
  \emph{EnvStats:  An R Package for Environmental Statistics}
  (Millard, 2013, \url{https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-8456-1}).

  For a complete list of functions and datasets, you can do any of the following:

  \itemize{
    \item See the help file \link[=FcnsByCat]{Functions By Category} for a listing of
          functions by category.
    \item If you are in the on-line help, scroll to the bottom of this help page and
          click on the \bold{Index} link.
    \item Type \code{library(help="EnvStats")} at the command prompt.
  }

  \bold{Note:}  The names of all \pkg{EnvStats} functions start with a lowercase letter, and
  the names of all \pkg{EnvStats} datasets and data objects start an uppercase letter.
  You can type \code{newsEnvStats()} at the \R command prompt for the latest news for
  the \pkg{EnvStats} package.

  A companion file \bold{EnvStats-manual.pdf} containing a listing of all the current help
  files is located on the \R CRAN web site at
  \url{https://cran.r-project.org/package=EnvStats/EnvStats.pdf}
  and also in the
  \bold{doc} subdirectory of the directory where the \pkg{EnvStats} package
  was installed.  For example, if you installed R under Windows, this file might be located
  in the directory \bold{C:\\Program Files\\R-*.**.*\\library\\EnvStats\\doc}, where
  \bold{*.**.*} denotes the version of R you are using (e.g., 3.3.4) or in the directory
  \bold{C:\\Users\\\emph{Name}\\Documents\\R\\win-library\\*.**.*\\EnvStats\\doc}, where
  \bold{\emph{Name}} denotes your user name on the Windows operating system.

  EnvStats comes with companion scripts, located in the \bold{scripts} subdirectory of the
  directory where the package was installed.  One set of scripts lets you reproduce the examples in
  the User's Manual.  There are also scripts that let you reproduce examples from
  US EPA guidance documents.

  See the \bold{References} section below for documentation for the predecessor to \pkg{EnvStats},
  \emph{EnvironmentalStats for S-PLUS} for Windows.

  Features of EnvStats include:

  \itemize{

    \item
    New functions for computing \link[=FcnsByCatSumStats]{summary statistics}, as well as
    creating \link[=FcnsByCatSumStats]{summary plots} to compare the distributions
    of groups side-by-side, including functions specifically designed to work with
    plots created with \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}
    (see \link[=FcnsByCatPlotUsingggplot2]{Plotting Using ggplot2}).


    \item
    New \link[=FcnsByCatProbDists]{probability distributions} have been added to the
    ones already available in \R, including the extreme value distribution and the
    zero-modified lognormal (delta) distribution.  You can compute quantities associated
    with these probability distributions (probability density functions, cumulative
    distribution functions, and quantiles), and generate random numbers from these
    distributions.


    \item
    \link[=FcnsByCatPlotProbDists]{Plot probability distributions} so you can see how they
    change with the value of the distribution parameter(s).


    \item
    \link[=FcnsByCatEstDistParams]{Estimate distribution parameters} and
    \link[=FcnsByCatEstDistQuants]{distribution quantiles}, and compute confidence intervals
    for commonly used probability distributions, including special methods for the
    lognormal and gamma distributions.


    \item
    Perform and plot the results of \link[=FcnsByCatGOFTests]{goodness-of-fit tests}:
      \itemize{
        \item Observed and Fitted Distributions
        \item Quantile-Quantile Plots
        \item Results of Shaprio-Wilk test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, etc.
      }
    Includes a new generalized goodness-of-fit test for any continuous distribution.
    Also includes a new function to choose among several candidate distributions.


    \item
    Functions for assessing optimal \link[=FcnsByCatDataTrans]{Box-Cox data transformations}.


    \item
    Compute parametric and non-parametric
    \link[=FcnsByCatPredInts]{prediction intervals, simultaneous prediction intervals},
    and \link[=FcnsByCatTolInts]{tolerance intervals}.


    \item
    New functions for \link[=FcnsByCatHypothTests]{hypothesis tests}, including:
      \itemize{
        \item Nonparametric estimation and tests for seasonal trend
        \item Fisher's one-sample randomization (permutation) test for location
        \item Quantile test to detect a shift in the tail of one population relative to another
        \item Two-sample linear rank tests
        \item Test for serial correlation based on von Neumann rank test
      }


    \item
    Perform \link[=FcnsByCatCalibration]{calibration} based on a machine signal to determine
    decision and detection limits and report estimated concentrations along with confidence
    intervals.


    \item
    Easily perform \link[=FcnsByCatPower]{power and sample size} computations and create companion
    plots for sampling designs based on confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, prediction intervals,
    and tolerance intervals.


    \item
    Handle singly and multiply \link[=FcnsByCatCensoredData]{censored (less-than-detection-limit) data}:
      \itemize{
        \item Empirical CDF and Quantile-Quantile Plots
        \item Parameter/Quantile Estimation and Confidence Intervals
        \item Prediction and Tolerance Intervals
        \item Goodness-of-Fit Tests
        \item Optimal Box-Cox Transformations
        \item Two-Sample Rank Tests
      }


    \item
    Functions for performing
    \link[=FcnsByCatMCandRisk]{Monte Carlo simulation and probabilistic risk assessement}.


    \item
    Reproduce specific examples in EPA guidance documents by using
    built-in data sets from these documents and running companion scripts.
